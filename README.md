# Programming-Practice_and_Principles_Using_Cpp
Record of C++ Learning Journey

This project is a record of my C++ learning journey. The goals are:
1) to catalog all solutions written by me to the exercises and questions presented in the textbook
2) to improve my documentation habits
3) to learn and build the habit of using Github
4) to get feedback about my code and coding habits from interested passerbys


*Note: Regretfully, I did not think about this when I first started learning. 
So I will be saving my solutions from the middle of chapter 4. 
However, I plan to go back to the earlier chapters eventually to make this project "complete".
